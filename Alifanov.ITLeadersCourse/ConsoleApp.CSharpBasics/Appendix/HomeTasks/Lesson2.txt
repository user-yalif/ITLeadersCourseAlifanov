1. Implement logic of Input and Output
2. Write a program which asks a user to guess a number between some range the user doesn't know (e.g. 10 and 20).
   Requirements:
   1. The user inputs an integer.
   2. If number is less than number to be guessed then program displayes message "You are wrong! Your number is less!".
   3. If number is grater than number to be guessed then program displayes message "You are wrong! Your number is grater!".
   4. If number is equal to number to be guessed then program displayes message "Correct! This is #."
   5. If number is out of range then program displayes "Your number is out of range!".

   Use if-else or nested if-else or switch statemnt
   Debug the program with different input parameters to make sure it works correctly.
